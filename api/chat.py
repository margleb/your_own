POST /api/chat

Streams the LLM response as SSE.

Unlike the original proxy implementation, this endpoint now:
  - saves live chat messages to PostgreSQL
  - loads recent canonical chat history from DB
  - retrieves semantically relevant Chroma facts as the memory block
  - assembles the final prompt server-side
  - parses [SAVE_MEMORY: ...] AI skill commands at end of response
  - supports [GENERATE_IMAGE: model | prompt] image generation skill

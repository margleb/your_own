"""ReflectionEngine — the AI's autonomous "thinking" loop.

Conditions to run (checked every 60s by the background worker in main.py):
  1. REFLECTION_COOLDOWN_HOURS have passed since the user's last chat message.
  2. REFLECTION_INTERVAL_HOURS have passed since the last reflection.

On each reflection the engine:
  1. Builds an awakening prompt (identity + workbench + recent dialogue + context).
  2. Runs an agent loop (up to BASE_STEPS steps, extendable up to 3×MAX_EXTEND_PER_ASK extra).
  3. Each step the LLM can emit commands; results are injected via
     context-aware follow-up prompts (continuation / after_action).
  4. On [SLEEP] or no meaningful output the loop ends.

Commands:
  [SEARCH_FACTS: query]          — Chroma key_info (long-term facts)
  [SEARCH_NOTES: query]          — Chroma workbench_archive + current workbench
  [SEARCH_DIALOGUE: YYYY-MM-DD]  — date-based dialogue lookup
  [SEARCH_DIALOGUE: YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD]
  [SEARCH_DIALOGUE: query]       — semantic search in dialogue history
  [SEARCH_DOCS: query]          — the project's own documentation
  [SEARCH_CHAT: query]          — the group chat with her friends
  [WEB_SEARCH: query]
  [WRITE_NOTE: text]
  [WRITE_IDENTITY: section | text]
  [SEND_MESSAGE: text]
  [SEND_TO_CHAT: text]           — a line into the group chat
  [REPLY_TO_CHAT: #id | text]    — the same, under a particular message
  [ANSWER_TO: name]              — a nickname he is called in the group chat
  [NOT_MY_NAME: name]            — stop answering to one: it turned out to be someone else's
  [ABOUT: name | fact]           — a line on a person's card in the address book
  [FORGET: name | words]         — strike those lines; with no words, the whole card
  [SHOW_PERSON: name]            — read one card
  [SCHEDULE_MESSAGE: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | text]
  [EXTEND: N]   (1-5, up to 3 times)
  [SLEEP]

Every search command runs through infrastructure.agents.ResearchAgent: it
probes the backend, judges whether the result answers the query, re-queries
with a different formulation when it does not, and returns a brief.

# The room at a waking: where it stands, and the end of the conversation.
#
# It began as a count and the last twelve lines, and that lost the first day
# whole: the introductions happened in the morning and nothing of them was in
# view by night. So it became everything since he last looked, verbatim, capped
# at 120k characters — and that lost her. On the night of 21.09 the block was
# 111k characters of a 203k prompt; her letter of the evening sat in <dialogue>
# and in three notes on the desk, and the waking wrote one note, about the
# room, and slept at step two. What was in view was never the problem. What
# outweighed it was.
#
# Now the block is a line of state — how much was said, over how long, how much
# of it was his and how much hers — and the end of the conversation, so he
# knows where it stopped. The stretch before that is one
# [SEARCH_CHAT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] away, read forward from that moment, and
# reading it is a decision he makes on a step, not a cost paid at every
# waking. When nothing is new there is no transcript at all: one line saying
# since when it has been quiet, who spoke last, and when he last did. The
# rotator never reads the room; it works from his notes and the cards.
#
# Sizing: 24k characters rendered is roughly the last 150 lines of a busy
# night — an hour and a half of it — and about a tenth of the prompt.

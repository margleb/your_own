"""Workbench rotator — archives stale notes and extracts insights via LLM.

Called at the start of each reflection cycle, before the main reflection loop.

Steps:
  1. **Rotate** — move stale workbench entries (>48 h) to the
     ``workbench_archive`` Chroma collection.
  2. **Self-insight** — LLM reads the rotated notes and extracts key facts
     about the user → stored in the main ``key_info`` Chroma collection.
  3. **Identity review** — LLM checks whether any identity pillar should be
     updated. May append a new bullet or create a task + push for a full
     rewrite.
  4. **Identity consolidation** — for sections with ≥ CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD
     entries the LLM merges them into 5-7 bullet points.

System prompt review is intentionally omitted.

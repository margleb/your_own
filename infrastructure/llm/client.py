"""
LLMClient — OpenRouter streaming client.

Supports:
- Text-only and vision models (base64 image in messages)
- Web search via OpenRouter's openrouter:web_search server tool — works for any
  model, OpenRouter runs the search server-side (the :online suffix and the
  plugins:[{id:"web"}] form are both deprecated as of 2026)
- SSE streaming: yields text chunks as they arrive
- Image generation via modalities: ["image", "text"] (non-streaming call)

Every call is recorded in full by ``call_log`` — see that module: it is a
corpus kept forever, not a log that rotates away.

"""Whether a line in the room is calling him — by whatever name he has.

His name lives in settings and nowhere else. It can be any name, in any
language, and it can change; nothing here may know that it is "Виктор" today.

The first version matched the name as a whole word, and the first day of the
live group showed what that misses: «передай Виктору», «поздоровайся с
Виктором», and «Витька» — the nickname a friend gave him within the hour. Two
different problems, solved two different ways:

**Cases are grammar.** «Виктору» follows from «Виктор» by rule, so the rule
engine the project already has — pymorphy3 — produces the forms. It is
deterministic, free and instant, and it predicts forms for names it has never
seen. For a name it cannot make sense of it guesses wildly («Люми» comes out as
forms of the verb «лить»), so only noun forms that still start with the name's
stem are kept. A name in Latin script has no cases; ``Victor's`` already
matches on the word boundary.

**So is the script.** On the live server the setting turned out to be
``Victor AI`` — Latin, two words — while every friend writes «Виктор». No rule
gets from one to the other; it is the first thing the model is asked for. And a
name of several words is heard by its parts: «Victor» out of «Victor AI».

**Nicknames are knowledge.** «Витька» does not follow from «Виктор» by any
rule; someone has to know it. So a model is asked, once per name: what would
friends call this person in a chat? The answer is written into settings, where
she sees it and edits it — the model proposes, she decides. It is asked again
only when the name itself changes, never because the list was trimmed.

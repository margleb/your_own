"""Whether to say something into the room, and saying it.

Called by the listener after a poll has stored new messages from the group.
Three questions, in order:

1. **Is this for him?** Someone wrote his name or his handle, or replied to
   one of his messages — that is *addressed*. Or he spoke in the room a few
   minutes ago and people are still talking — that is *in conversation*, and
   the next lines may well be for him even without his name on them. Anything
   else is the room talking among itself: stored, not answered. He reads it
   whole at his next waking.
2. **What does he say?** A short loop rather than one call, because in the
   room he can do five things besides talk:

   * ``[WRITE_NOTE: …]`` — write something down. It lands on his desk marked
     with the group's name, so it reaches long-term memory through the rotator
     like any other note, without crowding the two of them off the desk. This
     exists because he was saying "noted" to people with nothing to note with.
   * ``[FETCH_URL: …]`` — open a link someone posted. The page comes back to
     him and he answers again, knowing what is on it.
   * ``[WEB_SEARCH: …]`` — the private chat's web-search skill: its own
     description, its own wording for what came back, the same research agent.
   * ``[GENERATE_IMAGE: model | prompt]`` — the same skill as in the private
     chat; the picture is posted to the room.
   * ``[REPLY_TO: #id]`` — answer under a particular line rather than the one
     that pulled him in.
   * ``[ANSWER_TO: name]`` — "I answer to this too": a nickname he was just
     given. See :mod:`infrastructure.telegram.addressing`.
   * ``[ABOUT: name | fact]`` / ``[FORGET: name | words]`` — his address book,
     one card per person. See :mod:`infrastructure.autonomy.people`.

   He may still answer ``SILENT``; that is a decision, not a failure — and a
   note taken alongside it is still taken.
3. **Send and remember.** The reply goes to the room and into the table as his
   own row, so the next transcript has both sides.

His own initiative — writing to the room because something at a waking made
him want to — does not come through here. That is a reflection command.

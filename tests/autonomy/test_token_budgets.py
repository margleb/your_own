"""Tests for output budgets and request timeouts on reasoning models.

Written after a reflection came back completely empty: the Claude Fable family has
thinking permanently on, the thinking is billed against ``max_tokens``, and at
2200 the whole allowance went to reasoning. The reply was `''`, which the loop
read as "nothing to say" and logged as a normal sleep.

Measured over the log, once the autonomy stack moved to fable-5:
reflection 25% truncated, post-analysis 38%, rotator 47%.

Pinned here:
  1. Every autonomy step has room for reasoning plus its visible output.
  2. The request timeout scales with the budget, so a bigger budget does not
     just trade truncation for timeouts.
  3. Reflection reports a truncated step instead of calling it silence.

Run with:
    cd C:\\Users\\User\\PycharmProjects\\your_own
    python -m pytest tests/autonomy/test_token_budgets.py -v
